<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This is an adaptation of the official lasagne from the Bolognese Chamber of Commerce. 
    I've made a couple of changes suggested to me by people from the area, 
    such as which meat and wine to use or if there should be milk added or not.</p>
    <p>One thing never in question, though, is the green lasagne sheets. These are a must. 
        The ragu is an authentic sauce, simple without garlic or herbs and spices. 
        Using fresh pasta keeps you from having to pre-boil it.</p>
